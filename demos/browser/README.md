Include Lightning Connect without a bundler

## Install

Run `yarn install` here and in the parent directory.

## Development

**Please note:** compile speeds are slow due to the bundling of `index.browser.js`.

1. Run `yarn dev:browser` in the parent directory. This will build lightning connect into a self-contained javascript file.
2. Run `yarn dev` in this directory. This will serve the dev site and watch for changes.
